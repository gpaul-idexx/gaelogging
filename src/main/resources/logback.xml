    <!-- having this appender in the mix means that we can get logs into stackdriver without being associated with a request.
    I suspect GAE flushes the logs it accumulates in std out/err to the request log upon request completion
    (or something along those lines), and that's why stackdriver doesn't know about this. However, using this appender
     means that those logs aren't buffered/handled by app engine, instead, they are sent directly to stack driver -->
